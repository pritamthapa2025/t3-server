# API Development Workflow

## Before Making Any API Changes

**MANDATORY STEP:** Always read all existing cursor rules first:

1. 🔍 **Read `.cursor/rules/user-fk-names.mdc`** - for FK name patterns
2. 🔍 **Check other relevant rules in `.cursor/rules/`**
3. ✅ **Follow all applicable patterns**

## When Creating/Updating APIs

- **Create functions** must return enriched data (with `*Name` fields)
- **Update functions** must return enriched data (with `*Name` fields)
- **List functions** must include user/employee names
- **GetById functions** must include user/employee names

## Quick Rule Check

Before any service changes, ask yourself:

- Does this return records with `createdBy`, `approvedBy`, `assignedTo`, etc.?
- Am I returning enriched data with `*Name` fields?
- Did I call the `getById` function after create/update?

If unsure, **always read the cursor rules first!**
